# Chapter 4: The Processor

## 4.1 Introduction

> Chapter 1 explains that the performance of a computer is determined by three key factors: instruction count, clock cycle time, and clock cycles per instruction (CPI). Chapter 2 explains that the compiler and the instruction set architecture determine the instruction count required for a given program. However, the implementation of the processor determines both the clock cycle time and the number of clock cycles per instruction. In this chapter, we construct the datapath and control unit for two different implementations of the MIPS instruction set.
