# Chapter 1: Computer Abstractions and Technology

## 1.4 Under the Covers

> **Input devices** are hardware which the computer is fed information from (e.g., Mouse, Keyboard).
> 
> **Output devices** are hardware which the computer conveys the results of a computation to the user (e.g., Display, another computer).
> 
> **Integrated circuit** or **chip** is a device combining dozens to millions of transistors.
> 
> **Central Processing Unit (CPU)** is the hardware that follows the program's instruction (e.g., add, test, signals I/O, etc).
> 
> **Datapath** is the component of the processor that performs arithmetic operations.
> 
> **Control** is the component of the processor that commands the datapath, memory and I/O.
> 
> **Memory** storage area in which programs are kept when they are running, it also keeps the data needed for such programs.
> 
> **Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM)** is the memory built as an integrated circuit.
> 
> **Cache Memory** small fast memory access that acts as a buffer for a slower, larger memory.
> 
> **Static Random Access Memory (SRAM)** memory built as an integrated circuit, faster, used for cache.
> 
> **Instruction set architecture** is an abstraction interface between hardware and low-level software. It enables multiple implementations.
> 
> **Application Binary Interface (ABI)** is the combination of the basic instruction set plus the OS interface.
> 
> **Volatile** memory only retains data if it is receiving power. **Non-volatile memory** retains data even without power.
> 
> **Main memory** or **Primary Memory** is volatile memory.
> 
> **Secondary Memory** is non-volatile memory.
