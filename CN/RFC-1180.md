# RFC 1180: A TCP/IP Tutorial

> *This tutorial contains only one view of the salient points of TCP/IP,    and therefore it is the "bare bones" of TCP/IP technology.  It omits    the history of development and funding, the business case for its use, and its future as compared to ISO OSI.  Indeed, a great deal of technical information is also omitted. What remains is a minimum of information that must be understood by the professional working in a TCP/IP environment.  These professionals include the systems administrator, the systems programmer, and the network manager.*
