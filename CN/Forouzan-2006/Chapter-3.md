# Chapter 3: Data and Signals

## 3.1 Analog and Digital

> **Analog data** refers to information that is continuous; **Digital data** refers to information that has discrete states.

### Analog and Digital Signals

> An **analog signal** has infinitely many levels of intensity over a period of time. A **digital signal** can only have a limited number of defined values.

### Periodic and Non-periodic Signals

> A **periodic singal** completes a pattern within a measurable time frame, and repeats this pattern over subsequent identical periods. 
> 
> A **non-periodic signal** changes without exhibiting a patter or cycle that repeats over time.
