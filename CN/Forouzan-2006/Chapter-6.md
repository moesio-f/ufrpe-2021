# Chapter 6: Bandwidth Utilization: Multiplexing and Spreading

## 6.1 Multiplexing

> Whenever the bandwidth of a medium linking two devices is greater than the bandwidth needs of the devices, the link can be shared. **Multiplexing** is the set of techniques that allows the simultaneous transmission of multiple signals across a single data link.
