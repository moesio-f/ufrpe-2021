# Chapter 1: Introduction

> There is considerable confusion in the literature between a *computer network* (collection of autonomous computers interconnected) and a **distributed system** (collection of independent computers that appear to its uses a single system through a *middleware*).

## 1.2 Network Hardware

Broadly speaking, there are two types of transmission technology:
  - **Broadcast links**: communication channel is shared by all the machines in the network. In broadcast systems, there usually is the possibility of addressing specific computer to receive a *packet*. For instance, **broadcasting** enables all computer to receive the packet, while **multicasting** enables only a subset of computers to receive.
  - **Point-to-point links**: connect individual pairs of machines. Point-to-point transmission with exactly one sender and one receiver is sometimes called *unicasting*.


It is also possible to classify computer networks by scale:
  - Personal Area Networks (PAN)
  - Local Area Networks (LAN)
  - Metropolitan Area Networks (MAN)
  - Wide Area Networks (WAN)
